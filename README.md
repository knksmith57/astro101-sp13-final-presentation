ASTRO101 SP13 Final Presentation - Mars Past
============================================

A **heavily** hacked together [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation built for Kyle Smith, Anastassios Adamopoulos, Annalee Porter for their final presentation.

The [SPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) version of the project is the [astro101-sp13-mars-past-final-presentation.html](https://github.com/knksmith57/astro101-sp13-final-presentation/blob/master/astro101-sp13-mars-past-final-presentation.html) file. Everything else is just a piece of the puzzle. I'm not super good with all the grunt build config, so **I wouldn't run it as it** as it'll likely produce an unusable output file that will require some tweaking. Sorry bro, I'm still learning.


Disclaimers
-----------

1. We don't own anything in this document. Nada. Not the images, not the
   information, not the styling, not the js.
2. This is _purely_ for academic purposes. We're citing Academic Fair Use on
   all the Google Images- if you need to hate and want them taken down, get at
   me -> [@knksmith57](http://twitter.com/knksmith57).
3. This is an ASTRO101 presentation. It's not a thesis. It's definitely less
   accurate then Wiki (or, about as eqaully accurate, since a lot of this info
   _probably_ came from there). Don't quote us, bro.


Technical Details / shoutouts
-----------------------------

1. Built with the fabulous [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
   Props and thanks to [Hakim](http://hakim.se) for putting together such
   a sick slide framework.
2. Using [Ender](http://ender.jit.su/) + a bunch of modules for some of the
   hack work (ie: markdown image title -> style injection). Props to [@ded](http://twitter.com/ded) for
   making it so easy to hack this stuff together.
