This is a Markdown file. Basically a souped-up text file that gets rendered
into HTML (like the interwebs, bro).

Disclaimers

1. We don't own anything in this document. Nada. Not the images, not the
   information, not the styling, not the js.

2. This is _purely_ for academic purposes. We're citing Academic Fair Use on
   all the Google Images- if you need to hate and want them taken down, get at
   me -> @knksmith57.

3. This is an ASTRO101 presentation. It's not a thesis. It's definitely less
   accurate then Wiki (or, about as eqaully accurate, since a lot of this info
   _probably_ came from there). Don't quote us, bro.

Technical Details / shoutouts

1. Built with the fabulous [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
   Props and thanks to [Hakim](http://hakim.se) for putting together such
   a sick slide framework.

2. Using [Ender](http://ender.jit.su/) + a bunch of modules for some of the
   hack work (ie: markdown image title -> style injection). Props to @ded for
   making it so easy to hack this stuff together.

3. Open Source ftw.

## Evidence for past volcanic activity
### **Kyle Smith**


### vast differences in cratering

1. Northern plains are newer
  - less "features"
  - must have been "erased" by _something_
2. Volcanism may not be the only cause, but it is the most important


### tharsis bulge

Several large shield volcanoes concentrated in the western hemisphere in an area known as the **Tharsis Bulge**.

### tharsis montes

The three large volcanoes are collectively called **Tharsis Montes**


![Tharsis Montes][3]


### Olympus Mons

The tallest known volcano in the **solar system**

![Olympus Mons][4]

<!--
  - base covers the area of Arizona
  - peak 3x as high as Mount Everest
-->


![Olympus Mons 2][5]


### What happened to the volcanoes?

- As the planet cooled, less volcanic activity.

- less volcanic activity means less outgassing
- less outgassing means less greenhouse effect
- less greehouse effect + less magnetic field = less atmosphere


## Final thoughts

The existence of volcanoes helps explain other features

## Evidence for past liquid water
### **Anastassios Adamopoulos**


### evidence for past water
- Mars has polar ice caps and ice beneath the ground but evidence for present liquid water is unfound.
- Largely due to the very low temperatures.
- Mars demonstrates characteristics and patterns that suggest that liquid water once existed.
- Forms
  - Oceans covered large part
  - Lakes
  - Groundwater
  - Rainfall?


### riverbeds and valleys

- They are evident throughout Mars
- Water flowed in large amounts and with power

![river 1][6]
![river 2][7]


### chaotic terrain

- Disruption on the ground
- Sediments-Ice melts and sediments fall to the ground
- Flood

![chaotic][8]


### teardrops

- Behind craters: erosion from water around impact crater
- Islands beneath ocean or lake
- Mars Odyssey (2001)

![teardrop][9]


### delta

- Groundwater rose creating delta-similar to Earth
  - sediment movement
- Flood
- Delta is now rock
  - Possibly more layers in the past

![delta][10]


### mars-earth
#### Waterways - Curiosity
- Pebbles on the rock: water had eroded the rocks and pebbles were transported- Curiosity Rover

![mars-earth][11]


### rocks-sediments

- Sulfates in rocks indicate liquid water
  - Opportunity Rover (2004)
- European Space Agency claims to have found clear indication that an ocean existed in Mars (2012):
  - Sediments are alike those of an ocean.
  - Low density sediments
- A **few days ago** Opportunity Rover found that even drinkable water may have flowed: rock with clay minerals thus neutral ph



## The Martian landers
### **Annalee Porter**


### missions to mars

- Mariner 6 & 7: Launched in 1968
- Viking Landers 1 & 2: Launched in 1975
- Mars Global Surveyor: Launched in 1996
- Mars Pathfinder: Launched in 1996
- Mars Odyssey: Launched in 2001
- Mars Exploration Rovers: Launched in 2003
- Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter: Launched in 2005
- Phoenix Mars Lander: Launched in 2007
- Phobos–Grunt/Yinghuo 1: Launched in 2011
- Mars Science Laboratory: Launched in 2011


## Viking Lander Biological Experiments

- When the Viking spacecrafts were launched in the 1970’s, each spacecraft carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars
- These were the first Mars landers to use experiments to look for evidence of life on Mars. 
- They used a robotic arm to put soil samples into sealed containers on the craft. 
- The landers were identical, so the same tests were enacted on two places on Mars’ surface, Viking 1 near the equator and Viking 2 up North.

### The Four experiments carried out by Viking 1 and 2
#### **1. The Gas Chromatograph — Mass Spectrometer**

- This device can separate, identify, and quantify a large number of different chemicals
- However, the GCMS measured no significant amount of organic molecules in the Martian soil


### The Four experiments carried out by Viking 1 and 2
#### **2. The Gas Exchange**

  - This experiment looked for gases given off by an incubated soil sample by replacing the Martian atmosphere with the static gas, Helium
  - Periodically, the instrument sampled the atmosphere of the incubation chamber to measure the concentrations of several gases such as oxygen, CO2, nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane.
  - The scientists hypothesized that metabolizing organisms would either consume or release at least one of the gases being measured.
  - The result was negative.


### The Four experiments carried out by Viking 1 and 2
#### **3. The Labeled Release**

- In this experiment, the sample of Martian soil was inoculated with a drop of very “dilute aqueous nutrient solution.”
- The result was quite a surprise since the first two tests were negative. A consistent stream of radioactive gases were given off by the soil immediately following the first injection.
- However, when the same injections were administered a week later, the reaction was different, and the results remained inconclusive.


### The Four experiments carried out by Viking 1 and 2
#### **4. Pyrolytic Release**
- Light, water, and a carbon-containing atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), were released, simulating that on Mars.
- If there were photosynthetic organisms present, it was theorized that they would incorporate some of the carbon as biomass through the process of carbon fixation, just as plants and cyanobacteria on earth do.
- However, a very minute response was evidenced for biology.


## scientific conclusions
### 1

Organic compounds seem to be common, for example, on asteroids, meteorites, comets and the icy bodies orbiting the Sun, so detecting no trace of any organic compound on the surface of Mars came as a surprise.</small>


## scientific conclusions
### 2

At the time, the total absence of organic material on the surface made the results of the biology experiments moot, since metabolism involving organic compounds were what those experiments were designed to detect. However, the general scientific community surmise that the Viking's biological tests remain inconclusive.</small>


## scientific conclusions
### 3
Most researchers surmise that the results of the Viking biology experiments can be explained by purely chemical processes that do not require the presence of life, and the GC-MS results rule out life.</small>


## Controversy

While most astrobiologists still conclude that the Viking biological experiments were inconclusive or negative, many believe otherwise.

The current claim for life on Mars is grounded on old evidence reinterpreted in the light of recent developments.
